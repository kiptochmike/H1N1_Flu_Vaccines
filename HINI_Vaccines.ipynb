    "Vaccination stands as one of humanity's greatest achievements in public health, having effectively eradicated or controlled numerous diseases. However, recent years have witnessed a concerning rise in vaccine skepticism, leading to declining immunization rates and outbreaks of preventable diseases. Understanding the factors driving vaccine hesitancy and predicting vaccination uptake is imperative for public health officials and policymakers.\n",
